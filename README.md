## About this version

This series of versions, 0.3.x, are base on the version 0.2.7.0, which is deleted from this repo,
are unattached with Xinghuobei.

(Don not belive this => And about GiveYouAHead, I totally decided to stop develop this application. Because I think that those make tools can do what this can do, and there is no need to create a make-tool. So the version of 0.4.x or higher will be the history and nothing. (PS: This is history of my ideas.)

This repo and this tool might be continuing.
